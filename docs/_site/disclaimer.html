        <section><p>These are <strong>NOT</strong> official pages maintained by Utah State University. All views and opinions expressed herein are those of Joseph Wheaton, and not necessarily those of his current employer, Utah State University.</p>

<p>Most of the materials you will find here fall into one of four categories: 1) dissemination of my own research; 2) teaching materials; 3) pointers and links to information related to rivers, their management and/or my research; or 4) my own opinions and/or personal information. The material is all posted in the spirit of open and transparent access to information and is provided in the hope that it may be useful to other researchers, students, practitioners and/or decision makers. Every effort has been made to only host materials that are open-source or which I own the copyrights to (see below). If you find any problems (or spelling mistakes or errors), or have any suggestions, please feel free to <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/joewheaton.org/www/Home/contact">contact</a> me.</p>

<h2 id="informational-hyperlinks-disclaimer">Informational Hyperlinks Disclaimer</h2>

<p>The informational hyperlinks (e.g. <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/joewheaton.org/www/system/errors/NodeNotFound?suri=wuid:gx:2fac7f1e8b4874d">Rivers Information Page</a>) are strictly for providing you access to available information on the web I feel is relevant. The links to various web sites, papers and books within said pages is provided for informational purposes only. Absolutely no preference or endorsement of any one method or reference over another is therefore implied.</p>

<p>In short, I accept no responsibility for anything I said that was offensive or could somehow be used by a lawyer against me. Thanks for your common sense.</p>

<h2 id="intellectual-property-copyright">Intellectual Property Copyright</h2>

<p>All figures, images and text contained in these pages (exclusive of PDFs and hyperlinks outside the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joewheaton.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzc9196U0E1Lti831m4qKkoRXFQv5Q">http://www.joewheaton.org</a> domain) are copyrighted by Joseph Wheaton (©2004-2011) unless otherwise stated or cited. Every effort has been made to reference already copyrighted material appropriately as citations or web links. In the event that I have misquoted a copyright or you find a mistake, please bring it to my attention and I will promptly fix it or remove the material.</p>

<h2 id="published-materials">Published Materials</h2>

<p>There are a number of PDFs of my own published materials that, for convenience, may be downloaded by my collaborators from these pages. In some of these publications, I retain the copyright and anyone is free to download them. In others the publisher retains the copyright and therefore only collaborators or those with a valid subscription to the journal may download the PDFs. Otherwise, you will need to obtain the publication directly from the publisher. In all of the posted copyrighted PDFs, the copyright ownership is clearly stated within the PDF.</p>

<h2 id="downloading-images-figures-and-text">Downloading Images, Figures and Text</h2>

<p>Although I just got through explaining the copyrights for everything on these pages, the information on these pages is posted here so it may be used by others. In fact many of the images on these pages I have “borrowed” from friends, papers or other web sites. You do not need to contact me personally if you wish to download figures or images for your own personal use. However, if you wish to use any of the images, figures or text anywhere in these pages in a presentation, report or publication of any kind, please <a href="http://ctt.joewheaton.org/www/goog_1236537209018">contact me</a><a href="http://sites.google.com/a/joewheaton.org/www/Home/contact"> </a>first for a written permission. The copyrights for some content may have changed since posting or have been transferred to a publisher. In most other instances, I will provide you with either a proper citation or acknowledgment. Thank you for your courtesy.</p>
